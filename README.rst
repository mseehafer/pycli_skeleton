CLI Skeleton
================


This skeleton provides a base structure for a pip-installble command line application.

It is inpired by the alemic package and the tutorial found at
https://python-packaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/minimal.html.


The entry point is the main function in the config submodule.

After setting up an installable project we need to parse the args.
